**Lab 9: Adding custom plugins to extend the capabilities of Copilot for
Security**

**Introduction**

Copilot for Security comes with many default plugins and supports
several non-Microsoft plugins. You can also extend Copilot for
Security's capabilities by adding or creating your own plugin. The
Copilot for Security platform enables developers and users to write
plugins that can be invoked to perform specialized tasks.

**Objectives**

- To integrate a custom plugin into Microsoft Copilot for Security
  Standalone and utilize it to query geolocation information for a
  specified IP address.

**Task 1: Integrating a custom plugin and obtaining complete information
of a specific IP address**

**Summary**

In this lab, you’ve learned how to add custom plugins to Microsoft
Copilot for Security. You’ve uploaded a Geo.yaml file and successfully
integrated the IP Address Geolocation plugin. Then, you’ve used a prompt
for a specific IP address and gained insights into its city, region,
country, coordinates, timezone, and zipcode, thereby enhancing your
proficiency in custom plugin integration and geolocation querying within
the Microsoft Copilot for Security environment.
