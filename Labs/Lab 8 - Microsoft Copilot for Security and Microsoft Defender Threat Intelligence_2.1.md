**Lab 8 -** Using Copilot for Security standalone portal to get threat
intelligence 

**Introduction**

Copilot for Security delivers information about threat actors,
indicators of compromise (IOCs), tools, and vulnerabilities, as well as
contextual threat intelligence from Microsoft Defender Threat
Intelligence (Defender TI). You can use the prompts and promptbooks to
investigate incidents, enrich your hunting flows with threat
intelligence information, or gain more knowledge about your
organization. You can use many prompts to get information from Defender
TI.

    associated indicators of compromise (IOCs).

-   To obtain information about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
    (CVEs).

-   To provide feedback on the effectiveness and accuracy of the
    Defender Threat Intelligence integration with Copilot for Security.
