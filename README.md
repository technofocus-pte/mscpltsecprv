## A Deep Dive into Implementing Microsoft Copilot for Security

**Lab 1 - Setting up the environment for Microsoft Copilot for Security**

In this lab, you'll be assigning the Owner role to the Azure subscription, then you'll be creating and onboarding Windows Server and Windows 11 Pro virtual machines (testserver1, testVM1, and testVM2) to Microsoft Defender for Endpoints, bolstering security with real-time monitoring and threat response capabilities across different VM types. Then, you'll be creating a test user account (Robert Frost) with Microsoft 365 E5 and Microsoft teams enterprise licenses. Finally, you'll be installing Microsoft 365 apps and configuring necessary settings, facilitating a comprehensive testing environment for Azure, Microsoft Defender, and Microsoft Copilot for Security features.

**Lab 2 - Connecting Microsoft Sentinel in Microsoft Defender Portal for Threat Hunting, Triage, Investigation, and Respone**

In this lab, you'll gain valuable hands-on experience in setting up and configuring Microsoft Sentinel, a powerful security information and event management (SIEM) system. By following the detailed instructions, you'll be successfully creating a workspace and activate the Microsoft Sentinel free trial, ensuring a solid foundation for security monitoring and incident response. Additionally, you'll learn to connect crucial data connectors, such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender XDR, enabling seamless integration of security solutions within the Sentinel environment. Furthermore, you'll master the process of connecting Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR, consolidating security monitoring efforts and enhancing overall defense strategies. Your proficiency in these tasks equips you with essential skills for effectively managing and securing your organization's digital assets.

**Lab 3 - Creating a multi-stage incident in Microsoft Defender**

In this lab, you'll be installing and configuring Git on testvm1. You'll also be executing malicious documents and scripts. Then, you'll be simulating a ransomware attack using RanSim. Then, you'll be checking the protection actions and recommendations from Windows Security, examining details of quarantined and blocked threats. All these activities will create a multi-stage incident, which you will be analyzing using Microsoft Copilot for Security.

**Lab 4 - Creating a DLP policy and generating an alert in Microsoft Purview**

In this lab, you'll be setting up a Microsoft Purview account, then you'll configure custom Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies for Microsoft Copilot for Security, and create alerts in Microsoft Teams to test the effectiveness of these policies. This hands-on exercise will equip you with valuable skills in data protection and compliance management within Microsoft's ecosystem, enhancing your understanding of security measures in cloud-based environments.

**Lab 5 - Activating Security for Copilot using Azure subscription and analyzing the alerts generated in Microsoft Purview**

In this lab, you'll be configuring Microsoft Copilot for Security capacity in Azure portal and learn how to increase the SCU units. Then, you'll analyze the Custom DLP Policy Alert using Microsoft Copilot for Security.

**Lab 6 - Copilot for Security - Microsoft Defender embedded copilot to standalone copilot investigation**

In this lab, you'll learn to leverage Microsoft Defender's embedded and standalone Copilot for Security to investigate and analyze security incidents. You'll be navigating to the Microsoft Defender portal, investigating multi-stage incidents, and using Copilot to generate incident summaries. You'll develop the skills in analyzing malicious scripts, particularly obfuscated PowerShell commands, by reviewing key findings and generating incident summaries. Additionally, you'll learn to assess suspicious files through detailed file analysis and quickly evaluate device security postures, enhancing the overall incident response and security investigation capabilities.

**Lab 7 - Identity Risk Investigation and Mitigation with Microsoft Copilot for Security in Microsoft Entra**

This lab aims to mitigate a security incident by obtaining and disabling the involved user account. In this lab, you'll utilize Microsoft Copilot for Security Standalone to extract user group information and specific user details, including the user's Object ID. Then, you'll check the account status of the user and immediately disable the user account in Microsoft Entra. This proactive approach to identify and promptly acting on compromised user accounts demonstrates a crucial step in mitigating security threats effectively.

**Lab 8 - Using Copilot for Security standalone portal to get threat intelligence**

In this lab, you'll utilize Microsoft Copilot for Security Standalone to explore and access threat-related articles, enabling you to stay updated on the latest cybersecurity trends and emerging threats. Then, you'll obtain valuable insights into the Silk Typhoon threat actor including the associated indicators of compromise (IOCs), aiding in understanding the threat landscape and potential risks. You'll be accessing information about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Finally, the lab emphasized the importance of providing feedback on the effectiveness and accuracy of the Defender Threat Intelligence integration with Copilot for Security, contributing to the continuous improvement of cybersecurity tools and solutions. Through these tasks, you'll gain practical experience in leveraging threat intelligence to bolster the cybersecurity defenses and actively contributed to the refinement of security practices.

**Lab 9 - Adding custom plugins to extend the capabilities of Copilot for Security**

In this lab, you learn how to add custom plugins to Microsoft Copilot for Security. You'll be uploading a Geo.yaml file and integrate the IP Address Geolocation plugin. Then, you'll be using a prompt for a specific IP address and gain insights into its city, region, country, coordinates, timezone, and zipcode, thereby enhancing your proficiency in custom plugin integration and geolocation querying within the Microsoft Copilot for Security environment.
