# A Deep Dive into Implementing Microsoft Copilot for Security


**Lab 1 - Setting up the environment for Microsoft Copilot for Security**

In this lab, you'll be assigning the Owner role to the Azure subscription, then you'll be creating and onboarding Windows Server and Windows 11 Pro virtual machines (testserver1, testVM1, and testVM2) to Microsoft Defender for Endpoints, bolstering security with real-time monitoring and threat response capabilities across different VM types. Then, you'll be creating a test user account (Robert Frost) with Microsoft 365 E5 and Microsoft teams enterprise licenses. Finally, you'll be installing Microsoft 365 apps and configuring necessary settings, facilitating a comprehensive testing environment for Azure, Microsoft Defender, and Microsoft Copilot for Security features.
