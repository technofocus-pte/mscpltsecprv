# A Deep Dive into Implementing Microsoft Copilot for Security


**Lab 1 - Setting up the environment for Microsoft Copilot for Security**

In this lab, you'll be assigning the Owner role to the Azure subscription, then you'll be creating and onboarding Windows Server and Windows 11 Pro virtual machines (testserver1, testVM1, and testVM2) to Microsoft Defender for Endpoints, bolstering security with real-time monitoring and threat response capabilities across different VM types. Then, you'll be creating a test user account (Robert Frost) with Microsoft 365 E5 and Microsoft teams enterprise licenses. Finally, you'll be installing Microsoft 365 apps and configuring necessary settings, facilitating a comprehensive testing environment for Azure, Microsoft Defender, and Microsoft Copilot for Security features.

**Lab 2 - Connecting Microsoft Sentinel in Microsoft Defender Portal for Threat Hunting, Triage, Investigation, and Respone**

In this lab, you'll gain valuable hands-on experience in setting up and configuring Microsoft Sentinel, a powerful security information and event management (SIEM) system. By following the detailed instructions, you'll be successfully creating a workspace and activate the Microsoft Sentinel free trial, ensuring a solid foundation for security monitoring and incident response. Additionally, you'll learn to connect crucial data connectors, such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender XDR, enabling seamless integration of security solutions within the Sentinel environment. Furthermore, you'll master the process of connecting Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR, consolidating security monitoring efforts and enhancing overall defense strategies. Your proficiency in these tasks equips you with essential skills for effectively managing and securing your organization's digital assets.

**Lab 3 - Creating a multi-stage incident in Microsoft Defender**

In this lab, you'll be installing and configuring Git on testvm1. You'll also be executing malicious documents and scripts. Then, you'll be simulating a ransomware attack using RanSim. Then, you'll be checking the protection actions and recommendations from Windows Security, examining details of quarantined and blocked threats. All these activities will create a multi-stage incident, which you will be analyzing using Microsoft Copilot for Security.
